## Project idea
CAPTCHA systems are always evolving to ensure safety from bot attacks. The issue our project addresses is to attempt to use a pretrained model to build a machine learning algorithm that can accurately predict the correct symbols from a CAPTCHA image. By attempting to crack CAPTCHA systems, we can identify flaws in current systems to include when planning future systems.

## Data Set
The dataset we are using is the CAPTCHA Images dataset. The images are 5-letter words that can contain numbers. The photos have had noise applied to them (blur and a line), and they are 200 x 50 PNGs. This data set is built on 1070 images, which will need to be manipulated for accurate results.
